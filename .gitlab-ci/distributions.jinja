Template for reprepro distributions config file.

After this template gets expanded, with a paragraph for each
distribution codename supported,
the GPG fingerprint gets substituted into that at CI time using envsubst,
(not ahead of time using ci-fairy)
because the fingerprint is included in the "secrets" in CI.

Note: There is no way to indicate comments in the reprepro distributions config
file format, and whitespace is meaningful (need blank lines between paragraphs).

Please run the following after modifying this file:

    ci-fairy generate-template --config .gitlab-ci/config.yml .gitlab-ci/distributions.template > .gitlab-ci/distributions
